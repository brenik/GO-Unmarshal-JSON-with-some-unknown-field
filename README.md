# GO-Unmarshal-JSON-with-some-unknown-field
If you need to get some fields from JSON in Go, but you donâ€™t know the whole structure.

File data.json contains the classifier of economic activities in JSON format.

A file has many different fields, but I only need one. 

Not having the described structure is hard to get the right field. 

We use an array of empty interfaces to obtain the necessary data.
